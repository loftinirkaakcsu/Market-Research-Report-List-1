<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gel Adhesion Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gel adhesion barrier market is segmented into absorbable and non-absorbable types. Absorbable barriers, made from biodegradable materials, are designed to dissolve over time, promoting natural healing while reducing complications related to adhesions. Non-absorbable barriers, on the other hand, provide long-term protection against adhesions but remain in the body permanently, which can present risks of inflammation or infection. Both types are utilized in surgical procedures to minimize postoperative adhesions, enhancing patient outcomes and recovery.</p></p>
